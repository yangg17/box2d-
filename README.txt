This is a mini physics game engine. The game is made out of lines and circle. They are drawn on and postitioned.
The obstacles are static and circles are dynamic. This means the cirlces will bounce around and collide with
different things while the obstacles wil remain in the same position.It demostrates the ability of intersection
between objects and also collision detection between objects. When it collides, velocity will apply, therefore
it bounces off in the opposite direction. There are keyboard inputs which makes them interactive.Each keyboard inputs
will give you a different result.
